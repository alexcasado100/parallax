          <p>
            Bridges are like paths.
            They are always crossing our path, being a safe support.
            Guaranteed to be on the other side.
            Like bridges, there are people who provide the moment of this crossing.
            People who, by becoming a bridge, guide the way, turn on the light, stimulate courage, spread forgiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is necessary to pass over the bridges.
            The moment of just observing it may even exist, last for some time.
            But there will be the moment of crossing.
            The moment to let the luggage become lighter, and give wings to the feet.

          <h2>Be Beach</h2>
          <p>
            Staying on the beach watching the sea seems to bring us peace, it's as if time stopped, problems disappeared and only you and the sea were left.
            For a moment, you even have the impression that everything will be fine forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems that the beach transforms everyone, it's like everyone takes off their masks and sets free.
            Time doesn't matter that much, everyone enjoys the moment in their own way.
            Oh, I love the beach!

          <h2>Be Mountain</h2>
          <p>
            The life of each of us can be compared to conquering a mountain. Like life, it has its ups and downs. To be conquered, it must deserve detailed observation, so that the arrival at the top is successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            To climb the mountain of life, you have to learn to go up and down, fall and get up, but always come back with the same courage.

            Never give up on a new happiness, a new walk, a new landscape, until you reach the top of the mountain.
